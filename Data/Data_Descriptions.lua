EJ_Descriptions.Instances["DEADMINES"] = "It is said the Deadmines' gold deposits once accounted for a third of Stormwind's treasure reserves. Amid the chaos of the First War, the mines were abandoned and later thought to be haunted, leaving them relatively untouched until the Defias Brotherhood--a group of former laborers turned brigands--claimed the labyrinth as a base of operations for its subversive activities against Stormwind.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["SHADOWFANGKEEP"] = "Looming over Pyrewood Village from the southern bluffs of Silverpine Forest, Shadowfang Keep casts a shadow as dark as its legacy. Sinister forces occupy these ruins, formerly the dwelling of the mad archmage Arugal's worgen. The restless shade of Baron Silverlaine lingers, while Lord Godfrey and his cabal of erstwhile Gilnean noblemen plot against their enemies both living and undead.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["BLACKFATHOMDEEPS"] = "Once dedicated to the night elves' goddess Elune, Blackfathom Deeps was thought to have been destroyed during the Sundering, lost beneath the ocean. Millennia later, members of the Twilight's Hammer cult were drawn to the temple by whispers and foul dreams. After sacrificing untold numbers of innocents, the cult was rewarded with a new task: to protect one of the Old Gods' most cherished creatures, a pet that is still in need of nurturing before he can unleash his dark powers on the world.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["BLACKROCKDEPTHS"] = "The smoldering Blackrock Depths are home to the Dark Iron dwarves and their emperor, Dagran Thaurissan. Like his predecessors, he serves under the iron rule of Ragnaros the Firelord, a merciless being summoned into the world centuries ago.

Along with Ragnaros' servants, they have pushed the dwarves toward increasingly destructive ends that could soon spell doom for all of Azeroth.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["RAGEFIRECHASM"] = "Ragefire Chasm extends deep below the city of Orgrimmar. Barbaric troggs and devious Searing Blade cultists once plagued the volcanic caves, but now a new threat has emerged: dark shaman. Although Warchief Garrosh Hellscream recently called on a number of shaman to use the elements as weapons against the Alliance, the chasm's current inhabitants appear to be renegades. Reports have surfaced that these shadowy figures are amassing a blistering army that could wreak havoc if unleashed upon Orgrimmar.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["LOWERBLACKROCKSPIRE"] = "This imposing fortress, carved into the fiery core of Blackrock Mountain, represented the might of the Dark Iron clan for centuries. More recently, the black dragon Nefarian and his spawn seized the keep's upper spire and ignited a brutal war against the dwarves. The draconic armies have since allied with Warchief Rend Blackhand and his false Horde. This combined force lords over the spire, conducting horrific experiments to bolster its ranks while plotting the meddlesome Dark Irons' downfall.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["DIREMAUL"] = "Built thousands of years ago to house the kaldorei's arcane secrets, the formerly great city of Eldre'Thalas now lies in ruin, writhing with warped, twisted forces. Competing covens once fought for control of Dire Maul's corrupted energy, but they have since settled into uneasy truces, choosing to exploit the power within their own territories rather than continue to battle over the entire complex.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["GNOMERGAN"] = "Built deep within the mountains of Dun Morogh, the wondrous city of Gnomeregan was a testament to the gnomes' intelligence and industry. But when the capital was invaded by troggs, the gnomish high tinker was betrayed by his advisor Sicco Thermaplugg. As a result, Gnomeregan was irradiated, and most of its inhabitants slain. The surviving gnomes fled, vowing to return someday and retake their home.";
EJ_Descriptions.Instances["MARAUDON"] = "According to legend, Zaetar, son of Cenarius, and the earth elemental princess Theradras begot the barbaric centaur race.

Now, vicious centaur ghosts and twisted elemental minions roam every corner of the sprawling caves.";

EJ_Descriptions.Instances["SUNKENTEMPLE"] = "Thousands of years ago, the Gurubashi empire was plunged into a civil war by a powerful sect of priests, the Atal'ai, who sought to summon to Azeroth an avatar of their god of blood, Hakkar the Soulflayer. The Gurubashi people exiled the Atal'ai to the Swamp of Sorrows, where the priests built the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.

EJ_Descriptions.Instances["WAILINGCAVERNS"] = "Years ago, the famed druid Naralex and his followers descended into the shadowy Wailing Caverns, named for the mournful cry one hears when steam bursts from the cave system's fissures.
