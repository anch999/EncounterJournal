# EncounterJournal

Backport of Blizzard Encounter Journal for 3.3.5 modified for Custom Ascension content.

File Resources: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S1yrpheTZSCGQSVIEhF1mx3in0OguGRc?usp=sharing"> Encounter Journal Files </a>

You only need one of the 2 files resources.

For the ZIP folder, unzip and move the contents to: <wow_directory>\Interface\

For the Patch file, move to: <wow_directory>\Data\

If you already have a patch as the same from the download rename it to a number or letter not taken as it only adds texture files.
